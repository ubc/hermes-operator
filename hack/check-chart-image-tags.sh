# every operator image reference in the OLM bundle CSV, is well formed, tracks
# the current appVersion, and is actually pullable from the registry.
#
# Regression guard for #113, which had two distinct failure modes:
#
#   1. release-please wrote a bare version into values.yaml `image.tag` while
#      the release workflow only publishes v-prefixed tags, so a default
#      install rendered ghcr.io/...:0.1.18 and hit ImagePullBackOff.
#   2. After (1) was fixed by falling back to the chart's appVersion, the
#      release job packaged the chart with a v-prefixed --app-version while the
#      template added its own "v", shipping ghcr.io/...:vv0.1.19.
#
# (2) is why this script checks the *packaged* chart as well as the working
# tree: they can render different tags, and only the packaged one is published.
#
# Uses the anonymous registry token + manifest HEAD, so it needs no credentials
# for public images.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OLM bundle CSV (#129).
#
# The CSV carries the operator image in three places plus the CSV name, and
# release-please historically bumped only $.spec.version, so all four drifted
# years behind (containerImage sat at v0.1.10, the deployment and relatedImages
# entries at v0.1.0 while the release was v0.1.18). `make bundle-build` and
# `catalog-build` publish the in-tree CSV verbatim, so the drift shipped.
#
# They are now kept current by release-please's *generic* updater, driven by an
# inline `# x-release-please-version` marker. The generic updater rewrites the
# semver inside the line and leaves the rest alone, which is what preserves the
# leading "v". The yaml/jsonpath updater must NOT be pointed at this file at
# all, for two independent reasons:
#
#   1. It replaces the whole value with a bare version, which breaks the pull
#      (short-name resolution in the OperatorHub kiwi test) and stops
#      operatorhub-submit.yaml's `:v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+` sed from matching.
#   2. It round-trips the document through a YAML parse and re-emit, which
#      DROPS the `# x-release-please-version` comments. Observed on release PR
#      #152: the yaml updater bumped $.spec.version, stripped every marker, and
#      the generic updater then found nothing to bump, leaving all four image
#      references frozen at the previous release. `spec.version` therefore
#      carries a marker too and is bumped generically like the rest.
#
# So this checks: the marker is present on every versioned line (otherwise the
# next release silently leaves it behind), the value matches appVersion, the
# tag resolves, and no yaml updater is aimed at this file.
