# hermes-agent image build context

The operator owns `ghcr.io/paperclipinc/hermes-agent`. It is the **upstream
`nousresearch/hermes-agent` image** (an s6-overlay runtime that bundles the
gateway, dashboard, OpenAI-compatible API server, a Playwright/Chromium browser,
node, and every Python dependency) with operator metadata layered on top.

We intentionally do **not** rebuild the Python environment ourselves. The agent
is designed to run under s6 supervision (`/init` as PID 1, per-profile gateways,
profile reconcile on boot, browser under `/opt/hermes/.playwright`); reproducing
that from a bare `uv sync` is both fragile and incomplete (see #89). The operator
orchestrates the upstream image declaratively — it runs `hermes gateway run` with
the API server enabled and probes `/health` on the gateway port (see
`internal/resources/statefulset.go` and `docs/runtime.md`).

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | `FROM` the upstream image (pinned by multi-arch digest) + operator OCI/version labels. |
| `README.md` | This file. |

## Bumping the upstream version

1. Resolve the new multi-arch manifest digest for the desired upstream release:

   ```bash
   docker buildx imagetools inspect nousresearch/hermes-agent:<tag>
   ```

2. Update both the `FROM ...@sha256:<digest>` line and the `HERMES_VERSION` build
   arg (the value surfaced as the `hermes.agent/version` label, which the
   autoupdate controller compares against the registry tag) in `Dockerfile`.

3. The image is built, signed (Cosign keyless), SBOM-attested, and pushed by
   `.github/workflows/agent-image.yaml`.
